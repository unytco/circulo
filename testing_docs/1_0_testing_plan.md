### Overview
1. Why we are asking Partners to do testing
2. Test Plan
3. Feedback

### 1. Why we are asking Partners to do testing: 

Unyt is built with automated unit testing and reliability testing, and Holochain is continually expanding their performance testing. So we’re not seeking functional testing, but we are looking for feedback about:

*  **UX and UI usability** for what could be a complex or confusing process for end-users and/or project administrators.

* **Configurability to the needs and functions of your project**. We have gone from HoloFuel as a single-function currency, to a design that must be able to function in a variety of ways. We need to make sure Unyt functions how you need it to, because we can’t predict all those variants. Let us know if there is something you want to do that Unyt doesn't seem to support.

* **White Label / Branding dynamics**: We expect projects to customize some of the appearance of the interfaces to match their branding and we want to make sure we’ve made that work for your project.

* **Administrative Workflow questions** to ask yourself: What high level reports do you need to be able to see? Do your technical people understand how to update your configuration? Can they do so successfully? 

### 2. Test Plan

#### Phase 4: Testing Service Network Administration and Smart Agreements

Start: September 17, 2025
Duration: 4 weeks
Version: 0.34.0

Test usability of custom Smart Agreement configurations and system features

* include any service fee payment for YOUR agent to the invoicing process
* create and test service units relevant to your network.
* aggregate receives via a Smart Agreement SAVED (e.g. process bulk invoices via a log collector with a single payment)
* aggregate sends via a Smart Agreement SAVED (e.g. collection of transaction fees)


### 3. Feedback
We have set up this [feedback board](https://github.com/orgs/unytco/projects/5) for adding and tracking bugs, feature requests and other feedback. If you haven't yet done so, please share your github handle with us via our shared Telegram or Signal thread so that you can have access to that board.
